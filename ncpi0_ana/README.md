# ncpi0_ana

Analyze the LANTERN ntuples to evaluate reconstruction performance.

We want to know if we
   1) reconstructed the vertex
   2) how many detectable photons did we reconstruct?
   3) how many fake photons did we reconstruct?
   4) did the track particles get properly reconstructed?

The baseline of this analysis is a 2gamma+1proton final state.
