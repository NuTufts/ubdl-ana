# Scripts for performing t-SNE visualization of larmatch features

We would like to visualize the feature vector space that the larmatch network uses.

What we envision is first a visualization of the feature space itself.
I estimate that it will group by pattern-similarity.

We would also like to see the visualization in the last layer before true and false classification.
This will be more interesting.
The embedding will hopefully group by patterns oriented in the right relative direction.
We can also color code points based on their similarity in charge.
Could be fun.
