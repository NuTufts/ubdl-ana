#shower e vs gamma ana

Studies aimed at optiming e vs. gamma discrimination.

We use perfect reco showers to study variables, and then compare to reco showers.

Strategies to develop:

  1. better dedx measurement on trunk
  2. 3d-branching metrics
  3. missed 2nd shower pi0 metric
  4. shower likelihood

## Shower likelihood profile

Workflow:

  1. Make perfect reco file for perfect reco showers
  2. Run shower likelihood code to make profile histograms
