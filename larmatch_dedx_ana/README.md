# Scripts to execute dQdx analysis on larmatch output

Run `larflow/Ana/dedx_larmatch_from_true_tracks` to plot dqdx distribution using larmatch hits associated
to true reco points.

We will use these to build likelihoods and perform a PID analysis for muons and protons.

Target Plot for Paper

* dedq vs residual range
* PID using log-likelihood ratio vs true energy for muons and protons


## To Do

* dedx points [DONE]
* run on large sample and build likelihood histograms
* calculate pid for muon and proton tracks
* make PID separation vs track initial energy
